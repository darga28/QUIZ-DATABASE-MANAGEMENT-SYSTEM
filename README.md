# QUIZ-DATABASE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The project "Quiz Database Management" is a web-based application designed to facilitate the creation, administration, and completion of quizzes for students and teachers.

The system is implemented using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript for the front-end, MySQL as the database tool, and PHP for the back-end. 

The project implementation involves the conversion of the theoretical design into a functional system through careful planning, testing, and evaluation. Key tasks include creating database tables, implementing triggers and procedures, and conducting system testing to ensure that the system functions according to specifications
Wireframes are used to illustrate the interface design and layout of the web application, focusing on content organization and user interactions.

In conclusion, the "Quiz Database Management" project aims to provide a user-friendly platform for students to test their knowledge and for teachers to create and administer quizzes efficiently. The application offers features such as multiple-choice questions, performance tracking, and data analysis to enhance the learning experience for both students and teachers. Future enhancements may include hosting the platform on online servers, implementing backup mechanisms, distributing system loads, and improving the user interface for a more seamless experience.
